Record statistics for pool matches

Why? Because streamed pool matches are becoming more common, and we (I) want to know more about what's happening in a statistical sense when the matches are being played.

Named after the golden tonsils of Cueball TV, Jamie "Solid" Stevens (even though I tend to call him "Cat" Stevens instead).

Here’s a working list of things to record:

- Dry breaks
- Breaks where one or more balls are potted.
- Breaks where a foul is committed.
- Master breaks
- Single visit pot-outs
- Potting success
- Safety success
- Number of fouls
- Number of “mistakes"

If we can make recording real-time, it might also be nice to record average shot time.
